  paragpraphs:
  - We made it Atlas! That was a hell of a storm.
  - I know we survived but i wish the ship didn't take this much damage. We couldn't
    even get to the village port.
  - I'll stay here a bit. You can go ahead, i'm sure your brother Karian is waiting
    for you. I know you've missed him.
  - Sigh...
