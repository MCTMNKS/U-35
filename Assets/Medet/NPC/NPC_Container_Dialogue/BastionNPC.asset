  paragpraphs:
  - '... Atlas, look at you! You''ve changed so much, couldn''t even recognize you
    for a second there. '
  - 'I take that ship of yours couldn''t handle the big storm. It was terrible, you
    should hurry to the village and check up with the others. '
  - You can use the old village road, starts right back at where your ship crashed.
    You might need to jump around a bit, get across the river.
  - Also, if you feel creative you can use these logs i was chopping before the storm
    to make a bridge back there.
  - I'm trying to get myself together at the moment. I'll get back there later.
