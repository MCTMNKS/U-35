  - 'Atlas! You are back. I want to ask how you''re doing but I have some important
    news for you. '
  - Your brother, Karian disappeared last night. We wanted to check the old castle
    but we've encountered a magic disaster, some of the townsfolk disappeared too
    at that moment.
  - The town didn't get affected much but there was a storm, and something happened
    to the river and ocean water as well. It causes weird teleportations.
  - I need you to help me. I've locked old castle's door so that the village would
    be safe, my hands are tied here. I need to protect the village but we can't leave
    Karian alone!
  - I left the key to the castle at the pink rocks pond to keep it safe. Just climb
    the vines, you'll find it there. Take care.
  - Good luck...
