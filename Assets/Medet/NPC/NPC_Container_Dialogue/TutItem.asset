  paragpraphs:
  - Oof. Something is wrong with the water, must've been that magic disaster's doing
    or something. Heard the villagers talking about it.
  - Looks like you can use some apples. When you are in the first person mode (RMB)
    you can pick items with pressing the scroll button when looking at them.
  - Open your Inventory by pressing "I". Press "esc" to toggle mouse cursor. Now
    you can click on the apple and consume it to heal.
  - Pfft
