  - Hello! I'll be helping you with how to interact with this world. If you want
    to hear the full conversation wait for the current dialogue to finish and press
    E to continue.
  - You can keep pressing E, or simply walk away if you want to stop talking. Remember,
    you have to wait and listen if you want to read all of the dialogue!
  - See you soon!
  - Huh? No, i'm just a floating ball.
